# Dump of The Network Neighborhood Archive (networkneighborhoodarchive.neocities.org)
This is a dump of most of the now-offline website _The Network Neighborhood Archive_, which was located at [networkneighborhoodarchive.neocities.org](https://networkneighborhoodarchive.neocities.org). The website ran from at least [2017-03-02](https://web.archive.org/web/20170302135850/https://networkneighborhoodarchive.neocities.org/) to [around 2017-10-07](https://owlman.neocities.org/junk/networkneighborhoodarchive/). The project intended to compile "an unofficial archive for the defunct Network Neighborhood webring, featuring web archives, links to old sites, and some other noteworthy directories".

The website was run by now-former Neocities member [Jake of JakeOnline](https://web.archive.org/web/20180519151321/https://jakeonline.neocities.org), however, despite this, Jake would surrender all right to the website to the Network Neighborhood by saying in the file [bottom.js](bottom.js) by writing "All rights go to the Network Neighborhood".

As stated at the beginning, this is a dump of "most" of the site, meaning that not _everything_ has been saved. The Network Neighborhood Archive website was so small that it was in fact saved manually by hand, rather than running a program such as [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/), because of this, the page `not_found.html` (the 404 page) was forgotten in mirroring the project, however, it is unlikely it was all that special or even all that important to the overall workings of the website. Apart from the 404 page, everything else was saved.

# Disclaimer Regarding This Project
Just because I have mirrored a project by another person, this **does not mean** in any way, shape, or form that I agree or support the views of this project or even the person who made it, I have simply mirrored it for historical reasons as I have an interest in digital preservation. Over the years I have taken the time to archive many items, much of which can be seen [on my Internet Archive user page](https://archive.org/details/@14jammar). Following this, just because I have mirrored a project, this also does not mean that the author endorses me or my work.

If you are reading this and are wondering why exactly [that this disclaimer](https://github.com/DynTylluan/disclaimer) is inside of this project, it is simply here as a blanket way for getting out of trouble if myself or the project owner gets into hot water in some way, just in case. This is a standard text that is in all of [my GitHub](https://github.com/DynTylluan) mirrors and _does not automatically_ mean that the project owner is a bad person or is untrustworthy.

You are welcome to delete this file, as it will not affect the main part of the project in any way.
